Schwifty was created with the idea of making scheduling easier in a workplace environment. Within our team, members work in the service industry and problems with scheduling are prevalent. People may forget what time they work, need a cover for their shift, or they may need to input a sudden time off request. So with this in mind the purpose of Schwifty is to provide easier communication within a work environment.
