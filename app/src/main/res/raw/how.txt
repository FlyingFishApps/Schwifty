For our particular application we asked the participants to create a user with our signup page which requires creating a username, email, password, and choosing the type of user they are.  Next we asked them to sign in and explore the user interface features but mostly the schedule and time off features we had on our app.  For the schedule feature we simply asked the participants to add themselves into the system. For the time off we asked them to complete the form with any reason for requesting off work and to submit the form.  Finally we asked the participants to logout and afterwards they were asked to complete our survey questions.
